# Week 3 Homework - Due Monday, Week 4

This week we will build upon our recipe website/page. Using the entry level CSS we covered this week, mark up your recipe page (you should have a pure html markup already from last weeks assignment!) to have a header, footer, menu and side column. Play around with fonts, colors, margins, padding, floats, and any other CSS properties we have covered so far.
