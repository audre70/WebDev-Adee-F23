        <p> <!--Recipe description.-->
            This recipe was sourced from <em><a href ="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/best-snickerdoodles">bon appétit</a></em>. 
            Whether you like your snickerdoodle cookies cakey or chewy, this recipe has you covered. The secret to changing up their
            texture lies in how long you beat the cookie batter. For classic snickerdoodles with a cakey bite, beat for a full 3
            minutes after adding the eggs (set a timer: it’s longer than you think). This aerates the dough, leading to a striking
            crackly surface. For chewy snickerdoodle cookies, beat for just 30 seconds; their centers will be slightly more dense,
            preferable to some, and equally lovable in our books.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp. cream of tartar</li>
            <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
            <li>½ tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>½ cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup and 2 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 vanilla bean, divided</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p> 
            Whisk flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda, and kosher salt in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium speed
            (a stand mixer with paddle attachment or hand mixer are both fine), beat unsalted butter, melted, cooled slightly,
            light brown sugar, and granulated sugar in a large bowl, scraping down sides, until incorporated. Scrape in seeds from
            1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise; reserve pod for another use.
            <br>
            Add  eggs, room temperature, and continue to beat until mixture is pale yellow, begins to thicken, and falls from beaters 
            in a ribbon-like stream. Reduce mixer speed to low. Gradually add flour mixture to the wet ingredients and continue to beat, 
            scraping down sides and bottom of bowl, until just combined. Let sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes.
            <br>
            Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 400°. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk 1 Tbsp. ground cinnamon
            and remaining 2 Tbsp. granulated sugar in a small bowl.
            <br>
            Portion cookies and roll into 1½" balls. Toss in cinnamon-sugar mixture until well coated. Transfer to prepared sheet.
            <br>
            Bake cookies until edges are lightly browned and firm but centers are puffed and soft, 8–10 minutes. Let cool on sheets 10 minutes,
            then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.
