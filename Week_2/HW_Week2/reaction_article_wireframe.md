**My Thoughts:** This is a great article for someone who's learning about UX. It debunks some of the expectations someone might hold as they approach design, such as having to immediately form design solutions independently when presented with a problem. It was very useful for me to read that you shouldn't be shy in asking for feedback in particular. As someone who is indecisive and new to design, I was pleased to learn that UX designers work alongside developers and PMs throughout their process, and that it's okay to make mistakes because each project will involve a lot of trial and error and rough sketching before reaching the final product.

**Summary:**

UX is more than just problem solving--it's also about clear communication and discussion about the solution.
**Wireframing** is a useful and important tool to create new ideas and start this conversation before heading into the design process. The article defines it as "a process where designers draw overviews of interactive products to establish the structure and flow of possible design solutions."

The 5 important considerations for wireframing is as follows:
1. *Clarifying the problem.* Review user research and speak with knowledgeable customer service agenets/sales teams. You must find out everything you can about the problem before planning the solution.
2. *Workflows and Sketches.* Sketching screens and workflows for user is essential in producing important questions and points of focus for the design process. It will also help streamline process.
3. *Get feedback, early!.* Show designers, developers, and PMs what you're considering throughout the sketching process. Feedback is important throughout, and will help in building an ideal product. Will help you consider limitations, timeframe, and other unforeseen capabilties.
4. *Know your tools.* Turn sketches into beautiful designs in softwares you're comfortable and confident in.
5. *Know your audience.* "Fidelity of wireframes has to be tailored to audience."
