In this code, the greetUser function uses the prompt function to collect the user's name and favorite food. If both pieces of information are provided, it constructs a personalized message using a template string and displays it in a pop-up alert.

The greetUser function is called automatically when the page loads. You can save this code to an HTML file and open it in a web browser to see it in action.
