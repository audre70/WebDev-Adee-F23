# Final Project Proposal

My proposal for my final is a continuation/completion of my personal website. I wish to implement some major changes to my aesthetic/theme and interactions and also additions with all project subpages etc.

Bootstrap 
- I want to change my current code for responsive layout to using Bootstrap instead using grids.
- Utilize Bootstrap modals for my art gallery
- Create a bootstrap dropdown menu to filter projects when in responsive layout.

Javascript
- I have already implemented some Javascript to detect scroll position on my page and style my side nav bar links depending on the current section viewed.
- I have some p5.js coding projects. If I have time, I was wondering if I can embed those within a website page.
- I want to create a contact form as well on my contact page.


GSAP
