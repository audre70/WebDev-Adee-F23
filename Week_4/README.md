# Homework Week 4, due Monday Week 5: Midterm Proposal

###

-- 

Next week you will be presenting you midterm project proposals to your classmates. Plan on showing a README.md post and optional slideshow (or combination of the 2) describing a simple multipage website. README.md post / slideshow should include:

concept|theme of site (not just random images and links that show skill)
site map and wireframes
an existing website you drew inspiration from (bonus points for pinterest collection or mood board)
concepts|skills we have covered that you will use to build your site
concepts|skills you need to still learn to complete the project


at least 3 page website
5 mins tops presentation (recommend slideshow, link needed if so)
site map and wireframes, can use figma. shouldn't be complicated.
existing website you used inspiration from (bonus pts for mood board or pinterest colleciton)
concepts/skills we have learned that you'll use to build your site
concepts/skills you still need to learn

don't go crazy, just a 2 week project. only focus on html and css

figma -- switch button at top to go to developer side (instead of designer side).

resources -- paletton (color picker)
