# Midterm Proposal (Homework Week 4), due Monday Week 5: 

### Concept/Theme
My goal is to create a professional website for showing my projects/art/etc like a portfolio. The main page will be fairly straightforward with a one sentence and with an image background, and you can scroll down to preview works. There will be a nav bar to lead to further reading about projects, a bio section, and contact information.
