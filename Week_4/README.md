# Midterm Proposal (Homework Week 4), due Monday Week 5: 

### Concept/Theme
My goal is to create a professional website for showing my projects/art/etc like a portfolio. The main page will be fairly straightforward with a one sentence and hopefully some sort of simple animation, and you can scroll down to preview works. There will be a nav bar to lead to further reading about projects, a bio section, and contact information.

### Site Map & Wireframes

Next week you will be presenting you midterm project proposals to your classmates. Plan on showing a README.md post and optional slideshow (or combination of the 2) describing a simple multipage website. README.md post / slideshow should include:

concept|theme of site (not just random images and links that show skill)
site map and wireframes
an existing website you drew inspiration from (bonus points for pinterest collection or mood board)
concepts|skills we have covered that you will use to build your site
concepts|skills you need to still learn to complete the project


at least 3 page website
5 mins tops presentation (recommend slideshow, link needed if so)
site map and wireframes, can use figma. shouldn't be complicated.
existing website you used inspiration from (bonus pts for mood board or pinterest colleciton)
concepts/skills we have learned that you'll use to build your site
concepts/skills you still need to learn

don't go crazy, just a 2 week project. only focus on html and css

figma -- switch button at top to go to developer side (instead of designer side).
